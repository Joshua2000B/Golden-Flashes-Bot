Triggering content like ||self harm, suicidal thoughts/attempts||, as well as other potentially dark topics.

When using venting, it might be helpful to use this tag system by starting your post with one of the following emojis to cue to others what you are venting for as it can help prevent miscommunication:
üó£Ô∏è means **Seeking Advice/Help**
üôè means **Seeking Thoughts and Prayers**
üíõ means **Seeking Love and Support**
üëÇ means **Seeking a Listening Ear**

In addition to using the above tags, please be mindful of when people do not. If someone does not use the tags above and you are unsure what they are seeking from this channel, then ask them. A simple ‚ÄúAre you looking for advice or just to vent?‚Äù or something similar is almost always sufficient. 

Sometimes people need help, sometimes people need advice, and sometimes people just need to be heard. Keeping these emojis in mind can help prevent offending someone or overstepping. 

Finally, if you choose to vent about potentially triggering content, please use two | symbols on both sides of the content that may trigger someone, and it will shade it out like my warning earlier. If others wish to read it, they can click it and the text will appear, but those who are potentially easily triggered will know not to click it and we can protect the members of our server.
